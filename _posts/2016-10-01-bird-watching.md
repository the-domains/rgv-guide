# Bird Watching

Mission, Texas is located along the migratory path for birds as they make their way to their winter homes and back. Many of these birds will rest in back yards and city trees. However, for a more natural setting and greater variety of birds, birders prefer to visit some of the more natural areas.

Mission is home to one [World Birding Center][0] location in the Rio Grande Valley. The center is next to the [Bentsen - Rio Grande Valley State Park][1], which is excellent for catching some of the rare birds that migrate through the area. To the east, along the Rio Grande, is the [Anzalduas County Park and Dam][2], which offers a few more opportunities to view rare birds.

As birding tourism has grown, so has hospitality. Mission has several hotels to accommodate the annual influx of visitors, in addition to an even larger selection of RV parks.
