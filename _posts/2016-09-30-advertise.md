## Description

### Front Page Ad

A Front Page Ad is actually a full page ad with an image. The front page blurb will link to the full dedicated page for your business.

Your image can be of your business, a coupon graphic, an event announcement, or anything tasteful of your choice.

### Category Page Ad

A regular Page Ad will go at the top of the Business Directory category, or other page related to your business. This is an upgrade from just a bullet and link to your website.

### Free Listing

The only requirement to be listed on the MissionTexas.net guide is that your business should be in Mission.
