Mission has a [hike and bike trail][0] that is open to the public. The course runs almost five miles through brush and other back country. There is parking at the entrance of the trail. The other end of the trail stops at the entrance of the [World Birding Center][1] and [Bentsen Rio Grande Valley State Park][2]. 

The hike and bike trail is paved; however, many mountain bike enthusiasts like some of the trails that have been created for off-road riding. Many of these trails go through brush and cactus patches.

Besides the hike and bike trail, many of the roads around the outskirts of Mission have shoulders that give bikers a line for long rides. There are plenty of wide roads with relatively light traffic available. 

For good insight into bike riding in Mission, Texas you should visit the [Mission Trails Club][3] website.
