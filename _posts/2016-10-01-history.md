# History

The City of Mission, Texas was founded in 1908 after the Missouri Pacific Railway established a railway station near what is now the center of town. Mrs. Ann Voltz, a resident of nearby Madero, suggested that the new town be called Mission after La Lomita Mission.

Mission was the first area in the Rio Grande Valley to plant citrus. The modern citrus industry is now a multi-million dollar operation to this day.
