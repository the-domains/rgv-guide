# Welcome

Thank you for visiting MissionTexas.net, a site dedicated to providing information about the City of Mission, Texas.

Mission is the home of the ruby red grapefruit. We celebrate our citrus industry every year with the [Texas Citrus Fiesta][0].

We will be posting more information about this South Texas city as time permits.

Although every effort is made to categorize information correctly, some information does not fit into one single category and may result in duplicate entries.
