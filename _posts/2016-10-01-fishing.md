# Fishing

Mission does not have many natural bodies of water for fishing beyond the [Rio Grande][0]. Although the Rio Grande serves as an international boundary and is patrolled by Border Patrol agents, fishing is permitted along the river.   
To access the river, you must use the boat ramp at the [Anzalduas County Park and Dam][1] or at [Chimney Park RV Resort][2]. 

One other fishing spot is in the resaca at the [Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park][3]. 

You will occasionally see people fishing along some of the canals around Mission. Although the water that fills the canals is water that comes from the Rio Grande, many people find the practice questionable with respect to the quality of the fish. Typically, catfish are the most common type of fish caught along in the irrigation canals.
